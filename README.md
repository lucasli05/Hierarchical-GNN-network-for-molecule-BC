Reproducing “Graph Neural Networks for Prediction of Fuel Ignition Quality”
This repository contains a from-scratch reimplementation of Schweidtmann et al.’s GNN architecture for predicting fuel ignition quality (DCN, RON, MON). Building on their 1-GNN + 2-GNN hierarchical model, we’ve adapted the codebase for a binary molecular classification task—showcasing how the same high-order graph embeddings can be repurposed to classify molecules.
